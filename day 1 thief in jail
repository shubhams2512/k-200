/*
A thief is trying to escape from a jail. He has to cross N walls each with varying heights (every height is greater than 0). He climbs X feet every time. But, due to the slippery nature of those walls, every time he slips back by Y feet. Now the task is to calculate the total number of jumps required to cross all walls and escape from the jail.
Examples:
Input-1 : heights[] = {11, 11} X = 10; Y = 1;
Output : 4
Input-2 : heights[] = {11, 10, 10, 9} X = 10; Y = 1;
Output : 5
