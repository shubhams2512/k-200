/*
There are N bus stops numbered from 1 to N. B[i] denotes the number of buses going from the ith bus stop. Each bus will only stop in the bus stop which is the multiple of the bus stop the bus is initially in. which means if a bus starts from 2nd bus stop, it will only stop in 2,4,6,8,10,12…. bus stops. If 3 then, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18…. Each bus if it goes from the ith bus stop will also go from the next ith multiple bus stops. You need to tell the number of unique buses from each bus stop.
Input: An array of N the number of bus stops where N < 104
Output: Return an array of N numbers.
Test Case 1:
Input: 1 2 3
Output: 1 1 2
Explanation:
i=1, the bus will stop at all the i stop.
i=2, the bus will stop at all the bus stops which is a multiple of 2.
Test Case 2:
Input: 2 3 4 6
Output: 2 1 2 3
